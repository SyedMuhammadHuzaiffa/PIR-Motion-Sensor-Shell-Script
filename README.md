# PIR-Motion-Sensor-Shell-Script

## Introduction
The PIR (Passive Infrared) motion sensor is used to detect motion within a certain range. This project utilizes the PIR motion sensor to detect movement and trigger an LED to turn on using a Raspberry Pi. The project can be used for security purposes or as a home automation system. 

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
- To build a simple and low-cost motion detection system using a PIR sensor and Raspberry Pi
- To learn how to interface hardware components with Raspberry Pi using GPIO pins
- To learn how to write and execute Python and C scripts on Raspberry Pi
- To understand the basic concepts of motion sensing and home automation systems

## Project Details
The project uses a PIR motion sensor connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The PIR sensor detects motion and sends a signal to the Raspberry Pi, which then triggers an LED connected to another GPIO pin. The LED stays on for a certain duration and then turns off until the PIR sensor detects motion again. 

The hardware components used in this project are:
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- PIR motion sensor
- LED
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Resistor

The software used in this project is:
- Raspbian operating system
- Python programming language
- C programming language

## Results
The project was successfully implemented and tested. The PIR motion sensor accurately detects motion within a certain range and triggers the LED to turn on. The LED stays on for the defined duration and turns off automatically until motion is detected again. The project can be further enhanced by adding more functionality and integrating it with other home automation systems.

## Conclusion
The PIR motion sensor with Raspberry Pi project is a simple and cost-effective way to build a motion detection system. It can be used for security purposes or as a part of a larger home automation system. The project demonstrates how hardware components can be interfaced with Raspberry Pi using GPIO pins and how Python and C scripts can be used to control them.
